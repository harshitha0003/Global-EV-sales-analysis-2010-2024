# Global-EV-sales-analysis-2010-2024
The global electric vehicle (EV) sales analysis from 2010 to 2024 highlights a significant and rapid growth trajectory in the adoption of electric vehicles worldwide
# EV Data Prediction System

This Django web application allows users to load, preprocess, and analyze global electric vehicle (EV) data. It uses various machine learning models, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Decision Tree classifiers, to predict EV-related metrics based on multiple features such as region, category, and powertrain.

## Features

- **Login System**: Admin users can log in and access the dashboard for managing the data and running predictions.
- **Data Loading**: Uploads and preprocesses a CSV dataset, handling missing and infinite values.
- **Model Training**: Train and evaluate models using Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Decision Tree algorithms.
- **Prediction**: Allows users to make predictions based on input features such as region, category, mode, and more.
- **Model Comparison**: Visualizes and compares the accuracy of different models in predicting EV metrics.
